## Project: SCI EMG modeling

By: Guijin Li

Last update: Oct 31, 2023

This is the MATLAB package for an electromyography (EMG) signal generation model after spinal cord injury (SCI). It was developed based on models by Fuglevand, Farina, et al. for healthy neuromuscular systems, and modified to implement changes that can happen after SCI.

The folder “p1” contains single fiber action potentials (SFAP) for one “participant” with a unique motor unit territory (MUT) setup with 100 motor neurons (MN). 

To simulate SFAP for a participant, start from “runthis.m” to set up locations of each motor unit (MU) and all muscle fibers within a given MU, thickness of skin and subcutaneous fat layers, and other relevant parameters.

Simulating SFAP is time consuming. This step can be done on clusters such as the [Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) portal](https://www.nsgportal.org/). 

After SFAPs for participants are simulated, move back to the main folder and use “startExp.m” to set up experiments to investigate the different aspects of SCI, such as damages to upper and lower MNs, and muscle atrophy. In this script, MN recruitment and discharge are specified with “sn3DF_MUPool.m”, and motor unit action potential (MUAP) and subsequently surface EMG are generated by “sn4PT_MUPool.m”.
